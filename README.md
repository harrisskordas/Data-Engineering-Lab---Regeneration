In this final project we had to develop a robust Data Warehouse for a company called "Cataschevastika"
We divide the project in three smaller levels.
At first we were responsible for the datalake and depolyment of it.
After taht, we hadprovide advanced analytical capabilities for sales decision making
Last bu tnot least, we had to enhacne business insights trhough the use of Power BI

To be more Specific - Project Timeline:

1. Update of the OLTP Database -> we had to add more tables, because our previous OLTP Database didnt met the requirments
2. Creation of the Data Warehouse -> this step is divided into smaller steps: 1.staging 2.fact tables 3. view of tables 4. SCD TYpe 2(Row versioning)
3. Creation of the Datalake -> i is the deployment of local data warehouse to azure data lake
4. Databricks ML -> sales prediction with KMeans using databricks and pyspark
5. Visualization of results using Power Bi
